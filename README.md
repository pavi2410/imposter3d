# Imposter3D

A 3D multiplayer game inspired by Among Us, built with React Three Fiber and Socket.IO.

## Project Structure

This project uses a monorepo structure with the following packages:

### packages/client

The frontend application built with:
- React 19
- Three.js
- React Three Fiber (@react-three/fiber)
- React Three Drei (@react-three/drei)
- Socket.IO Client
- Vite as the build tool

The client handles game rendering, player movement, tasks, and impostor actions.

### packages/server

The backend server built with:
- Node.js
- Socket.IO

The server manages game rooms, player connections, game state, and synchronizes player actions across clients.

### packages/shared

Shared code and constants used by both client and server, including:
- Player colors
- Game configuration
- Shared types and interfaces

## Socket.IO Protocol

The game uses Socket.IO for real-time communication between clients and server. Here are the main events:

### Client to Server Events

| Event | Payload | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `createRoom` | `{ name, color }` | Creates a new game room with player customization |
| `joinRoom` | `roomCode, { name, color }` | Joins an existing room with the given code |
| `leaveRoom` | - | Leaves the current room |
| `startGame` | - | Starts the game (host only) |
| `updatePlayer` | `{ position, rotation }` | Updates player position and rotation |
| `killPlayer` | `targetId` | Impostor action to kill another player |
| `completeTask` | `taskId` | Marks a task as completed |
